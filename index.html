    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
    <p>I'm currently taking the "Build Websites From Scratch" intensive workshop at Codecademy and built this initial site for myself using Atom, git-bash and GitHub. Check back early and often to see what I've done with the place. My first project will be compiling a list with links to my genealogy columns, but I'm going to hold off until I can learn a little more about CSS. See you soon!</p>
