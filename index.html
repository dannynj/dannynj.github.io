    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
    <p>I'm currently taking the "Build Websites From Scratch" intensive workshop at <a href="www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and built this initial site for myself using <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a>, <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io" target="_blank">git-bash</a> and <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Check back early and often to see what I've done with the place. My first project will be compiling a list with links to my genealogy columns, but I'm going to hold off until I can learn a little more about CSS. See you soon!</p>
